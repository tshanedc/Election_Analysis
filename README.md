# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Python


# Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections requested that I complete the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the Total Number of Votes Cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
 Data Source: election_results.csv
 Software: Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.2
  
 ## Overview of Election Audit:
 After completing the initial results analysis, I was asked by the election officials to provide some additional data:
 1. The voter turnout for each county
 2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
 3. The county with the highest turnout

I applied *for* loops and conditional statements to the existing dataset to complete the audit, printing the results to the command line and to the election_results text file.
 
 ## Election-Audit Results:
 + There were 369,711 votes cast across the three counties for all candidates in this congressional election.
    - Denver County collected 82.8% of the vote.
    - Jefferson County collected 10.5% of the vote.
    - Arapahoe County comprised the smallest share of the total vote, 6.7%.
