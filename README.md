# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Python


# Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections requested that I complete the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the Total Number of Votes Cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
 Data Source: election_results.csv
 Software: Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.2
 
 ## Summary
 The analysis of the election show that:
 There were 369,711 votes cast.
 The candidates were Diana DeGette, Charles Casper Stockham, and Raymon Anthony Donae.
 The results were as follows:
 In first place and therefore the winning candidate was Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes. This was 73.8% of all votes cast.
 In second place with 85,213 votes (23% of popular vote) was Charles Casper Stockham.
 In third place with a mere 3.1% or 11,606 votes was Raymon Anthony Doane.
 
 ## Challenge Overview
 After completing the initial results analysis, I was asked by the deep state to provide some additional data:
 1. The voter turnout for each county
 2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
 3. The county with the highest turnout

I applied *for* loops and conditional statements to the existing dataset to complete the audit, printing the results to the command line and to the election_results text file.
